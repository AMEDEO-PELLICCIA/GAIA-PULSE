# GAIA-PULSE (GP-00) Tunneling
# GAIA-PULSE Tunneling

A secure and efficient tunneling solution for network communications.

## Overview

GAIA-PULSE Tunneling provides a robust framework for creating secure tunnels between networks, enabling protected data transmission across potentially insecure networks. This tool is designed with performance, security, and ease of use in mind.

## Features

- **Secure Connections**: End-to-end encryption for all tunneled traffic
- **Multiple Protocol Support**: Works with TCP, UDP, HTTP, and more
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal latency overhead for tunneled connections
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and containerized environments
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive logging and real-time monitoring capabilities
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic reconnection in case of network failures

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher
- OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GAIA-PULSE/Tunneling.git
cd Tunneling
make build
I'll help you create a README.md file for your GAIA-PULSE/Tunneling project. Here's a comprehensive template you can use:

```markdown project="GAIA-PULSE/Tunneling" file="README.md"
...
```

### Using Pre-built Binaries

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/GAIA-PULSE/Tunneling/releases) page.

## Quick Start

1. Configure your tunnel in `config.yaml`:


```yaml
tunnel:
  name: "example-tunnel"
  local_endpoint: "localhost:8080"
  remote_endpoint: "remote-server:9090"
  encryption: "aes-256-gcm"
  compression: true
```

2. Start the tunnel:


```shellscript
./gaia-tunnel --config config.yaml
```

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file supports the following options:

| Option | Description | Default
|-----|-----|-----
| `name` | Tunnel identifier | `default`
| `local_endpoint` | Local address to tunnel from | `localhost:8080`
| `remote_endpoint` | Remote address to tunnel to | Required
| `encryption` | Encryption algorithm | `aes-256-gcm`
| `compression` | Enable data compression | `false`
| `reconnect_attempts` | Number of reconnection attempts | `5`
| `reconnect_delay` | Delay between reconnection attempts (seconds) | `5`


## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Tunnels

You can configure multiple tunnels in a single configuration file:

```yaml
tunnels:
  - name: "web-tunnel"
    local_endpoint: "localhost:8080"
    remote_endpoint: "web-server:80"
  
  - name: "db-tunnel"
    local_endpoint: "localhost:5432"
    remote_endpoint: "db-server:5432"
    encryption: "chacha20-poly1305"
```

### Custom Authentication

For enhanced security, you can configure custom authentication methods:

```yaml
tunnel:
  # ... other options
  auth:
    type: "certificate"
    cert_file: "/path/to/cert.pem"
    key_file: "/path/to/key.pem"
```

## Monitoring

GAIA-PULSE Tunneling provides a built-in monitoring dashboard accessible at `http://localhost:9091` when the tunnel is running with the `--monitor` flag.
